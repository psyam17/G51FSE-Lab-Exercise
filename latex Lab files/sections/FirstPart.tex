\section{First Member}
This is the section dedicated to one of the team members, and it should be written individually . It can include a range of things; first subsection is a space for you to point out the strengths and weaknesses of the module, including complaints about the module coordinator Max Wilson. The second section should have a selfie image with Max! The last part of it is the most important one. You will need to write a paragraph about what you have learned in this module. You can write it in \textbf{Bold} if you want or you can use other fonts. 

Please do not forget:
\begin{itemize}
	\item First paragraph should have your comments about the module
	\item Second one, a selfie img with Max
	\item Last one, what you learned in this module.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comments about the module}
The module is just great.Any slight sign of annoyance I have show so far is just a mistake on my part and it will never be repeated again. God bless dr. Max Wilson for his delivery and the uni for picking this module to teach to us.
